## A little history.
Before I tallk about linux we need to travel back to **1964** in this year
*MIT* along with *General Electric* and *Bell Labs*
started to create a operating system called **Multics**
after a while in 1969 Bell Labs pulled out of the project.

> The story is not over yet
Multics development continued at General Electric and MIT.
*some of the people that worked in Bell Labs Keep working on the project as a result unix was created*

Unix development started in the 1970s at the Bell Labs by *Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie*



It all started In **August 25, 1991** when a person that named Linus Torvalds 
decided to create a free operating system something small just for hubby
years later this project become one of the most important projects in the history
